        This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous
        classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Ou goal is to create greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
        to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
        We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
        active learning and traditional machine learning approaches.

        The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often regarded as the “brain” of the computer. It performs and executes instructions and carries out mathematical and logical operations. It is found inside the billions of technological devices we have today: in smartphones, smartwatches, computers, laptops and even washing machines. However, as the demand for processors increased, so does the need for faster, more efficient, and more performative processors. In this article, we will analyse how increasing the bit-size directly contributed to the performance of faster microprocessors, and how this was achieved.
