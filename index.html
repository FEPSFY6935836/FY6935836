        This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous
        classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Ou goal is to create greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
        to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
        We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
        active learning and traditional machine learning approaches.

        The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often regarded as the “brain” of the computer. It performs and executes instructions and carries out
        mathematical and logical operations. It is found inside the billions of technological devices we have today: in smartphones, smartwatches,
        computers, laptops and even washing machines. However, as the demand for processors increased, so does the need for faster, more efficient,
        and more performative processors. In this article, we will analyse how increasing the bit-size directly contributed to the performance of faster
        microprocessors, and how this was achieved.

    <p class="ex1">
      In 1971, Intel created the world's first general purpose microprocessor – the Intel 4004. This processor was made for the Japanese calculator company, Busicom, who had asked Intel to design a chip for their calculating machine (Intel, n.d.). Intel consequently designed the 4004 microprocessor. It consisted of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which performed all the mathematical and logical operations; a set of data registers, which temporarily stored values that the microprocessor needed; and control circuitry, which made use of a data bus to transport the values and information along the different parts of the processor that needed it.

    <h3 id="Limitations of the 4-bit processor">Limitations of the 4-bit processor</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      The Intel 4004 was a 4-bit microprocessor, which meant it could only carry and process 4 binary digits at a time (Faggin, 2018). A binary digit is 1 or 0, which represents 2 possible states, on or off. As the processor could carry and process 4 binary digits at a time, it meant it could represent a total of 16 possible combinations. This resulted in the Intel 4004 excelling at calculations involving numbers 0-15. However, any calculations resulting or involving numbers above 15 would have to involve programming and hardware workarounds which took a significantly longer amount of time, as the microprocessor was only designed to carry 4 bits (Faggin, 2018). Thus, this limitation led to the conclusion that increasing the bit size would be necessary to improve the performance of the CPU.
