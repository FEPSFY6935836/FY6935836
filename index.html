        This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous
        classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Ou goal is to create greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
        to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
        We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
        active learning and traditional machine learning approaches.

        The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often regarded as the “brain” of the computer. It performs and executes instructions and carries out
        mathematical and logical operations. It is found inside the billions of technological devices we have today: in smartphones, smartwatches,
        computers, laptops and even washing machines. However, as the demand for processors increased, so does the need for faster, more efficient,
        and more performative processors. In this article, we will analyse how increasing the bit-size directly contributed to the performance of faster
        microprocessors, and how this was achieved.

    <h3 id="The first commercial microprocessor">The first commercial microprocessor</h3>
    <p class="ex2">
      In 1971, Intel created the world's first general purpose microprocessor – <b>the Intel 4004</b>. This processor was made for the Japanese calculator company, Busicom, who had asked Intel to design a chip for their calculating machine <a href="#ref1">(Intel, n.d.)</a>. Intel consequently designed the 4004 microprocessor. It consisted of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which performed all the mathematical and logical operations; a set of data registers, which temporarily stored values that the microprocessor needed; and control circuitry, which made use of a data bus to transport the values and information along the different parts of the processor that needed it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Limitations of the 4-bit processor">Limitations of the 4-bit processor</h3>
    <p class="ex2">
      The Intel 4004 was a 4-bit microprocessor, which meant it could only carry and process <b>4 binary digits</b> at a time <a href="#ref2">(Faggin, 2018)</a>. A binary digit is 1 or 0, which represents 2 possible states, on or off. As the processor could carry and process 4 binary digits at a time, it meant it could represent a total of 16 possible combinations. This resulted in the Intel 4004 excelling at calculations involving numbers 0-15. However, any calculations resulting or involving numbers above 15 would have to involve programming and hardware workarounds which took a significantly longer amount of time, as the microprocessor was only designed to carry 4 bits <a href="#ref2">(Faggin, 2018)</a>. Thus, this limitation led to the conclusion that <i>increasing the bit size would be necessary to improve the performance of the CPU.</i>
    </p>
    <h3 id="Increasing the bit size">Increasing the bit size</h3>
    <p class="ex2">
      In order to increase the bit size, it is essential to understand what transistors are. A transistor functions as a microscopic electronic switch, representing the two binary states, 1 (“on”) and 0 (“off”). They sit on the board of the microprocessor and are necessary for microprocessors to function. The Intel 4004 required approximately 2,300 transistors to function <a href="#ref3">(Faggin, Hoff, Mazor and Smith, 1996)</a>. To increase the bit size from 4 bits to 8 bits, 16 bits or more, Intel would require a substantially larger number of transistors. This would have presented two challenges for Intel. Firstly, scaling up the transistor count directly depended on the manufacturing rates. Manufacturers would have to mass produce thousands, and eventually millions, of microscopic switches that functioned perfectly at faster rates and higher yields. Secondly, Intel would need to be able to achieve a higher transistor density – by packing a significantly greater number of transistors onto the same chip area without increasing the size of the chip. Due to technological constraints at the time, these two problems were a significant barrier to increasing the bit size of processors.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Transistor production scale">Transistor production scale</h3>
    <p class="ex2">
      The first barrier – yield and production scale - was addressed by rapid advancements in manufacturing taking place at the time. These advances were noted by Faggins, who stated that in 1959 tens of silicon transistors could be fabricated at the same time, but by 1969 it grew to thousands of transistors <a href="#ref2">(Faggin, 2018, para. 1)</a>. An increase in the number of transistors capable of being produced meant that securing a sufficient supply of transistors was no longer a problem for Intel. With more transistors at hand, it directly allowed them to launch the 8008, the first 8-bit processor, in less than 6 months of releasing the 4004. This microprocessor could process 8 binary digits at a time, leading to 256 possible combinations and values that could be represented (letters, numbers, or even symbols) <a href="#ref4">(Morse, Ravenel, Mazor and Pohlman, 1980)</a>. However, while the continual increasing in the production scale of transistors solved Intel’s issue of supply, it did not solve the problem of <i>achieving a higher transistor density.</i>
    </p>
    <h3 id="Moore’s Law">Moore’s Law</h3>
    <p class="ex2">
      Achieving a higher transistor density was reached through advances in photolithography – the process used to etch microscopic circuits onto silicon. As this technology improved, so did the size of transistors. Transistors could be manufactured at smaller scales and could be miniaturised progressively. This consequently meant more of them could fit onto the surface of the chip, as they were smaller. This progressive advancement led to an industry trend, observed by Gordon Moore, who stated that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubled approximately every 2 years <a href="#ref5">(Mack, 2011)</a>. This observation became known as Moore’s Law, and it described the exponential miniaturisation of the transistor that effectively became the breakthrough for Intel’s problem of achieving higher transistor densities <a href="#ref5">(Mack, 2011)</a>. His law became accurate for the next 50 years, as evidenced by <i>Figure 1</i>, and became a guiding principle for the semiconductor industry (Roser, Ritchie and Mathieu, 2023).

    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="ex2">
      In this article, we have analysed how increasing the bit-size directly contributed to the performance of microprocessors. We have analysed the two obstacles that had to be overcome to increase the bit size: transistor production and miniaturisation. With the 2 obstacles overcome, the bit size of microprocessors was able to rapidly increase, enabling the progression to 16-bit, 32-bit, and our modern 64-bit processors. The CPU bit-size revolution was consequently achieved by overcoming these 2 challenges - unlocking exponential growth in the performance and processing power of the CPUs that define our digital era.
